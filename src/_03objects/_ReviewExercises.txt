R8.1 Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is the act of providing a public interface and hiding the implementation details. Every class has a public interface,
    which is a collection of methods through which the project of the class can be manipulated. Encapsulation is useful because it enables
    changes in the implementation without affecting users of a class. In other words, encapsulation enables safe way to program. It makes
    all instance variables private, while providing an user with public gettor and settor method.

R8.4 Public interface
    Q: What is the public interface of a class? How does it differ from the implementation of a class?

    Public interface is a set of methods through which the objects of the class can be manipulated. This means that user must know the public
    interface in order to work with a given object. On the other hand, the user doesn't need to know how the object's data or its methods are
    implemented. For example, private instance variables an essential part of encapsulation.

R8.7 Instance versus static
    Q: What is an instance method, and how does it differ from a static method?
    Instance method is a method invoked on an object. An instance method has an implicit parameter which is hte object that the method is invoked on.
    An instance method may have zero or more explicit parameters. On the other hand, a static method is not invoked on an object.


R8.8 Mutator and accessor
    Q: What is a mutator method? What is an accessor method?
    A mutator method modifies the object on which it operates on while an accessor method queries the object for some information without changing it.

R8.9 Implicit parameter
    Q: What is an implicit parameter? How does it differ from an explicit parameter?
    Implicit parameter is an object that an instance method is invoked on. It is called implicit because in Java, you don't actually need to write the
    implicit parameter in the method declaration. However, explicit parameters are clearly mentioned in the method declarations.

R8.10 Implicit parameter
    Q: How many implicit parameters can an instance method have? How many implicit parameters can a static method have?
    Q: How many explicit parameters can an instance method have?

    You can have only one implicit parameter that an instance method can invoke.
    A static method has no implicit parameters.
    An instance method can have as many explicit parameters as it can have. No limit.

R8.12 Constructors
    Q: How many constructors can a class have? Can you have a class with no constructors?
    Q: If a class has more than one constructor, which of them gets called?

R8.16 Instance variables
    Instance variables are “hidden” by declaring them as private, but they aren’t hidden very well at all. Anyone can read the class declaration.
    Explain to what extent the private reserved word hides the private implementation of a class.

R8.19 The this reference
    What is the this reference? Why would you use it?

R8.20 Zero, null, false, empty String
    What is the difference between the number zero, the null reference, the value false, and the empty string?
