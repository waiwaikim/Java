This is a shoot 'em up style game. You are a P38 pilot which will be spawned in the lower middle with 5 lives.
Your goal is to stay alive for the next three minutes. It will be difficult.
You can move your plane using the four arrow keys.
If you want to move the plane faster you can keep pressing A key while moving around.
If you release A key, the speed of the plane will revert back to the normal.

There is a floater called PowerUp. This will give you an extra live. It will float around
in random directions and expire in roughly 12 seconds. You can consume a PowerUp when you have
5 lives, but it will not give you an extra live. The number of lives is maximized at 5.

There are 3 major types of enemy. The first enemy is a Japanese Zero fighter jet. It shoots bullets straight down the screen.
It moves in three different directions. It can move straight down. It can move diagonally to the right.
I can move diagonally to the left. You can kill this foe with one bullet.

The second enemy is a bigger Japanese bomber. It should SmartBullet that tracks you. It will move towards you down the screen.
If you collide with any plane, both the enemy and you will die!!!

The third enemy is a frigate. It will be on the ocean, so you can't collide with it. It comes with five turrets that shoot
at different directions. You must kill all turrets before sinking a ship. You need to hit a turret once to destroy. You need
to hit a ship ten times in order to sink it.

I think it's quite hard. I haven't made it through three minutes, so good luck and have fun!
