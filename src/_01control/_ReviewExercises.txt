R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.


R2.4 Write the following mathematical expressions in Java
1/ double s = s0 + (v0*t)  + (0.5*g*Math.pow(t, 2));
2/ double FV = PV * Math.pow((1 + INT/100), YRS);
3/ double G = 4*Math.pow(Math.PI, 2)*Math.pow(a,3)/ ((Math.pow(p,2) * (m1 + m2)));
4/ double c = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a,2)+Math.pow(b,2) - (2*a*b* Math.cos(gamma)));

R2.7 Understanding integer operations, order of precedence, and integer division.
a/ 8
b/ 1
c/ 17
d/ 17.5
e/ 17
f/ 18

R2.14 How the compiler interprets primitive values
The difference between 2, 2.0, '2', "2", and "2.0"? 2 is interpreted as int.
2.0 is interpreted as float or double. '2' is char. Both "2" and "2.0" are String

R2.17 Pseudocode understading
    user input - read a full name as a String
    Parse the input by ' ' and insert in an array

    empty String = s
    For an element in array;
        append the index 0 of element to String s

    print s

R2.22 More pseudocode - you do not need to draw a diagram for this question

    days = "SunMonTueWedThuFriSat";
    day_number = 4 ;
    starting_pos = day_number *3 = 4*3 = 12 ;
    my_day = days[12: 12+3] = "Thu" ;
    print(my_day) ;

R3.19 Pseudocode for grade problem

    //the program takes a numerical integer input and output a letter grade

    if grade >= 90 and grade <= 100;
        print "A"
    else if grade >=80 and grade<=89;
        print "B"
    else if grade >=70 and grade<=79;
        print "C"
    else if grade >=60 and grade<=69;
        print "D"
    else if grade <60;
        print "F"

R3.30 Boolean expressions
a/ false
b/ true
c/ true
d/ true
e/ false
f/ false
g/ false
h/ true

R4.12 Implementing loops
// Java supports for loop, while loop and do loop

    for(initiate; condition; increment or decrement){
        //code
    }

    while(condition){
        //code
    }

    do{
        //code
    }while(condition)

R4.14 Calendar problem
