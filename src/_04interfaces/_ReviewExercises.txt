    a.Employee, Manager
        Superclass - Employee
        Subclass - Manager
    b.GraduateStudent, Student
        Superclass - Student
        Subclass - GraduateStudent
    c.Person, Student
        superclass - Person
        subclass - Student
    d.Employee, Professor
        superclass - Employee
        subclass - Professor
    e.BankAccount, CheckingAccount
        superclass - BankAccount
        subclass - CheckingAccount
    f.Vehicle, Car
        superclass - Vehicle
        subclass - car
    g.Vehicle, Minivan
        superclass - Vehicle
        subclass - Minivan
    h.Car, Minivan
        superclass - Car
        subclass - Minivan

        subclass - Truck

R9.2 superclass and subclass
    Q: Consider a program for managing inventory in a small appliance store.
    Why isn’t it useful to have a superclass SmallAppliance and subclasses Toaster, CarVacuum, TravelIron, and so on?

    A: It doesn't make sense to have a superclass for Toaster, CarVacuum, TravelIron because the attributes of those appliances
    are very different. It seems they don't have common functionality.

R9.4 SavingsAccount
    Q: Which methods does the SavingsAccount class in How To 9.1 inherit from its superclass?
    Which methods does it override? Which methods does it add?

    A: SavingsAccount class inherits 1) deposit(), 2) withdraw(), 3)getBalance() and 4) monthEnd()
    SavingsAccount class overrides withdraw() to ensure the balance is above the minimum balance.
    Also, it overrides monthEnd() to deposit earned interest at the end of a month.

R9.6 Sandwich
    Q: Suppose the class Sub extends the class Sandwich. Which of the following assignments are legal?
       Sandwich x = new Sandwich();
       Sub y = new Sub();
       a.x = y;
       b.y = x;
       c.y = new Sandwich();
       d.x = new Sub();

       A: a. x=y; and d. x=new Sub(); are legal. These two assignments are downcasting from a superclass to subclass.
       While b. and c. are upcasting are NOT legal because they are potentially dangerous assignments.

R9.7 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located
    Q: Draw an inheritance diagram that shows the inheritance relationships between these classes
        •Person
        •Employee
        •Student
        •Instructor
        •Classroom
        •Object

    A: Please find R9_7.puml w/ Car.java

R9.8 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located
    Q: In an object-oriented traffic simulation system, we have the classes listed below.
    Draw an inheritance diagram that shows the relationships between these classes.
        •Vehicle
        •Car
        •Truck
        •Sedan
        •Coupe
        •PickupTruck
        •SportUtilityVehicle
        •Minivan
        •Bicycle
        •Motorcycle

    A: Please find R9_8.puml w/ Car.java
R9.9 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located
    Q: What inheritance relationships would you establish among the following classes?
        •Student
        •Professor
        •TeachingAssistant
        •Employee
        •Secretary
        •DepartmentChair
        •Janitor
        •SeminarSpeaker
        •Person
        •Course
        •Seminar
        •Lecture
        •ComputerLab

    A: please find R9_9.puml w/ Car.java

R9.10 Casting
    Q: How does a cast such as (BankAccount) x differ from a cast of number values such as (int) x?

    A: The (BankAccount) x cast is casting the variable type of the object without changing its value.
    On the other hand, (int) x cast can actually change the underlying primitive value.

R9.11 instanceof operator
    Q: Which of these conditions returns true? Check the Java documentation for the inheritance patterns.
    Recall that System.out is an object of the PrintStream class.

    A:
    a.System.out instanceof PrintStream - True
    b.System.out instanceof OutputStream - True
    c.System.out instanceof LogStream - False
    d.System.out instanceof Object - Ture
    e.System.out instanceof Closeable - False
    f.System.out instanceof Writer - False
