R12.1 OO Analysis and Design
    Q: List the steps in the process of object-oriented design that this chapter recommends for student use.

    A: First, we need to discover classes. Often, nouns are classes and verbs are methods.
    Second, we need to determine the responsibilities of each class. We can use CRC card method.
    Thirdly, we need to determine the relationship among the classes.

R12.2 OO Analysis and Design
    Q: Give a rule of thumb for how to find classes when designing a program

    A: Classes often correspond to nouns in the requirement specifications.

R12.3 OO Analysis and Design
    Q: Give a rule of thumb for how to find methods when designing a program.

    A: Methods often correspond to verbs in the requirement specifications.

R12.8 Relationships
    Q: Write CRC cards for the Coin and CashRegister classes described in Section 12.1.3.

    A: CRC Card for Class: Coin, Responsibility: stores the value of a coin, Collaborators: None
       CRC Card for Class: CashRegistor, Responsibility: totals up sales and compute change due, Collaborators: Coin

R12.9 CRC Quiz
    Q: Write CRC cards for the Quiz and Question classes in Section 12.2.2.

    A: CRC for Class: ChoiceQuestion, Responsibility: a question with multiple choices , Collaborators: inherits from Question
       CRC for Class: Question, Responsibility: a question with a text and answer , Collaborators: None
       CRC for Class: Quiz, Responsibility: contains a list of questions , Collaborators: Question


R12.10 UML Quiz
    Q: Draw a UML diagram for the Quiz, Question, and ChoiceQuestion classes. The Quiz class is described in Section 12.2.2.

R12.11 CRC Cards
    Q: A file contains a set of records describing countries. Each record consists of the name of the country, its population,
    and its area. Suppose your task is to write a program that reads in such a file and prints
       •The country with the largest area.
       •The country with the largest population.
       •The country with the largest population density (people per square kilometer).

   Think through the problems that you need to solve. What classes and methods will you need? Produce a set of CRC cards,
   a UML diagram, and a set of javadoc comments.

    A: CRC for Class: Country, Responsibilities:  contains a country name and its information, Collaborators: None
       CRC for Class: FileOrganizer. Responsibilities: returns a country with a desired attribute, Collaborator: Country

R12.13 UML Diagram
    Q: Consider the following problem description:
       Users place coins in a vending machine and select a product by pushing a button.
       If the inserted coins are sufficient to cover the purchase price of the product, the product is dispensed and change is given.
       Otherwise, the inserted coins are returned to the user.

R12.14 UML Diagram
    Q: Consider the following problem description:
       Employees receive their biweekly paychecks. They are paid their hourly rates for each hour worked;
       however, if they worked more than 40 hours per week, they are paid overtime at 150 percent of their regular wage.

       What classes should you use to implement a solution?

R12.15 ULM Diagram
    Q: Consider the following problem description:
       Customers order products from a store. Invoices are generated to list the items and quantities ordered, payments received, and amounts still due.
       Products are shipped to the shipping address of the customer, and invoices are sent to the billing address.
       Draw a UML diagram showing the aggregation relationships between the classes Invoice, Address, Customer, and Product.
